  <h3>March Madness — the collegiate men's and women's basketball tournaments —owes its name to Illinois and high school ball. Back in 1908, the Illinois 
    High School Association began sponsoring a statewide tournament that became so popular by 1939 that it routinely sold out the University of Illinois 
    gymnasium. This tournament was dubbed "March Madness" by Henry V. Porter, an executive with the IHSA who wrote an essay about it. The nickname grew to 
    be the official title used by the media and eventually, the IHSA used it in its publicity materials and trademarked the name in 1989.March Madness was 
    first used to refer to basketball by an Illinois high school official, Henry V. Porter, in 1939, but the term didn't find its 
    way to the NCAA tournament until CBS broadcaster Brent Musburger (who used to be a sportswriter in Chicago) used it during coverage of the 1982 tournament.
    The biggest upset in March Madness is Landing on the wrong end of an 83-77 scoreline came as a major shock to the system, and saw Knight presiding over a 
    first-round exit for the first time in his long career. The defeat proved to him that while Steve Alford was a great player, he couldn't do all the heavy 
    lifting alone.</h3>

  <br>
  <h3><i><u><font color="white">Gonzaga Bulldogs</font></i></u>:The best team in college basketball this season -- and in many seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
      <u><i><font color="white">Baylor Bears</font></i></u>: A team that's almost completely fallen back into its groove of dominance. 
  <br>
  <br>
      <i><u><font color="white">Michigan Wolverines</font></u></i>: A skillfully coached team that was faded hard by many and predicted to fall prior to the Elite Eight 
      but has nonetheless averaged 81.3 points without its best player (Isaiah Livers) and separated from all of its opponents 
      by the 10-minute mark of the second half.
   <br>
   <br>
      <i><u><font color="white">USC Trojans</font></u></i>: An overlooked team finally getting its respect. USC has won its three games by 64 points, which is the second-largest 
      aggregate margin of victory by any seed No. 6 or worse in history. Listen, my bracket is sort of a shambles. 
   <br>
   <br>
      <i><u><font color="white">Houston Cougars</font></u></i>: The No. 3-ranked team at KenPom get a little bit lucky but also exert its will on teams. 
   <br>
   <br>
      <i><u><font color="white">UCLA Bruins</font></u></i>: A revival of a blue blood. UCLA's 88-78 win over Alabama Sunday night at Hinkle was a game I'd rank in the top three of 
      the tournament.
   <br>
   <br>
      <i><u><font color="white">Arkansas Razorbacks</font></u></i>: The  team that's had the shakiest way to get to this point. The Razorbacks beat TTU and Oral Roberts by two points 
      apiece and would no longer be in the field had Max Abmas' 3-point attempt been two inches to the right. But it wasn't, and Arkansas is 
      still dancing.
   <br>
   <br>
      <i><u><font color="white">Oregon State Beavers</font></u></i>: One of the most unlikely regional-final runs from a power-conference team in history.</h3>
