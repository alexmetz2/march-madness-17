  <h3>In 1985 Michael Lewis graduated from the university of Kentucky when he was on the basketball team. During his time there, he met many colleagues and decided 
    to start a basketball supplies and maintenance company. The first store was located in his hometown of Lexington Kentucky and with the help of some of his 
    teammates, colleagues, and friends, the company quickly grew to 25 stores across 15 states in the United States. From our humble beginning of just selling 
    shoes to our copious amount of products, we love what we do and look forward to continuing to being you amazing products and services. Below is more on our m
    anagement team.</h3>
