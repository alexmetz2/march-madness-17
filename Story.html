  <h3>March Madness — the collegiate men's and women's basketball tournaments —owes its name to Illinois and high school ball. Back in 1908, the Illinois 
    High School Association began sponsoring a statewide tournament that became so popular by 1939 that it routinely sold out the University of Illinois 
    gymnasium. This tournament was dubbed "March Madness" by Henry V. Porter, an executive with the IHSA who wrote an essay about it. The nickname grew to 
    be the official title used by the media and eventually, the IHSA used it in its publicity materials and trademarked the name in 1989.March Madness was 
    first used to refer to basketball by an Illinois high school official, Henry V. Porter, in 1939, but the term didn't find its 
    way to the NCAA tournament until CBS broadcaster Brent Musburger (who used to be a sportswriter in Chicago) used it during coverage of the 1982 tournament.
    The biggest upset in March Madness is Landing on the wrong end of an 83-77 scoreline came as a major shock to the system, and saw Knight presiding over a 
    first-round exit for the first time in his long career. The defeat proved to him that while Steve Alford was a great player, he couldn't do all the heavy 
    lifting alone.</h3>
